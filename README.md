IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION


The Iris flower dataset consists of three species: setosa, versicolor,
and virginica. These species can be distinguished based on their
measurements. Now, imagine that you have the measurements
of Iris flowers categorized by their respective species. Your
objective is to train a machine learning model that can learn from
these measurements and accurately classify the Iris flowers into
their respective species.



Iris flower classification is a classic machine learning problem that involves predicting the species of an iris flower based on its sepal and petal measurements.
The iris dataset is a popular dataset for machine learning tutorials because it is relatively small and easy to understand, but it still poses a challenging classification problem.

There are three species of iris flowers in the dataset: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Each species has its own unique characteristics, such as the size
and shape of the sepals and petals. However, there is some overlap between the species, which makes classification challenging.

Machine learning algorithms can be used to learn the patterns in the iris dataset and develop a model that can accurately predict the species of a new iris flower.
This model can then be used to identify unknown iris flowers or to classify iris flowers in real time.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
This project will develop and evaluate a machine learning model for iris flower classification. The model will be trained on the iris dataset, 
which contains 150 iris flower samples, each with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The model will then
be evaluated on a held-out test set to assess its accuracy.
